// Tortoise racing

/*
Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. 
Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. 
How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) 
and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds 
(round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.

If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None or {-1, -1, -1} 
for C++, C, Go, Nim, Pascal, COBOL, Erlang, [-1, -1, -1] for Perl,[] for Kotlin or "-1 -1 -1".

Examples:
(form of the result depends on the language)

race(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or "0 32 18"
race(80, 91, 37)   => [3, 21, 49] or "3 21 49"
Note:
See other examples in "Your test cases".

In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any 
redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.

** Hints for people who don't know how to convert to hours, minutes, seconds:

Tortoises don't care about fractions of seconds
Think of calculation by hand using only integers (in your code use or simulate integer division)
or Google: "convert decimal time to hours minutes seconds"
