// Twice as old

// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son 
// (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  return dadYearsOld - sonYearsOld * 2 > 0 ? dadYearsOld - sonYearsOld * 2 : sonYearsOld * 2 - dadYearsOld
}

console.log(twiceAsOld(36,7));  // 22
console.log(twiceAsOld(55,30));  // 5
console.log(twiceAsOld(42,21));  // 0




function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
