// Difference between years. (Level 1)

/*
Write a function that receives two strings as parameter. 
This strings are in the following format of date: YYYY/MM/DD. 
Your job is: Take the years and calculate the difference between them.

Examples:
'1997/10/10' and '2015/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18 
'2015/10/10' and '1997/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18
At this level, you don't need validate months and days to calculate the difference.

var howManyYears = function(date1, date2){
  return Math.abs(date2.split("/")[0] - date1.split("/")[0])
}

console.log(howManyYears('1997/10/10', '2015/10/10')); // 18
console.log(howManyYears('1990/10/10', '2015/10/10')); // 25
