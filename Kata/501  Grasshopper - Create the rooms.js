// Grasshopper - Create the rooms

/*
Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. 
The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties 
(e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
  "Kitchen": {name:"Kitchen", description:"Room for beginners", completed:"Yes"},
  "Hall": {name:"Hall", description:"Feel the fear", completed:"No"},  
  "Bedroom": {name:"Bedroom", description:"Nightmares", completed:"No"},  
};
