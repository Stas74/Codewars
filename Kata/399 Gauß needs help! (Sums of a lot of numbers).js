// Gauß needs help! (Sums of a lot of numbers)

/*
Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, 
to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, 
while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers 
from 1 through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, 
he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 
It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. 
If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL).

Note: the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula 
and how you can do performance optimization on your code. 

Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

function f(n) {  
  return !Number.isInteger(n) || n < 1 ? false : (1 + n) / 2 * n ;
}

// S(n) = na + bn (n-1) / 2

console.log(f(100)); // 5050
console.log(f(300)); // 45150
console.log(f("n")); // false




function f(n){
  return (parseInt(n) === n && n > 0) ? n * (n+1) / 2 : false;
};



function f(n){
  /* This problem can be solved using the summation function in math "n * (n + 1) / 2"
   * Number must be greater than 0 and NOT a decimal hence n % 1 must equal to 0
   * Wrapped up in a beautiful ternary expression you get:
   */
    
  return (n % 1 !== 0 || n <= 0)? false : (((n + 1) * n) / 2) ;
};
